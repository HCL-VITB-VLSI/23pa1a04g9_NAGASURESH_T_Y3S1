## 🎯 About CodeCraft Challenges  
These challenges are meant for **basic practice of Verilog HDL coding** for chip design.  

- 🖥️ Learners’ task is to **write the Verilog HDL code** and prepare design reports.  
- 🧪 The **testbenches shall be provided** by the SME to learners.  
- 📂 Learners must submit a **GitHub repository** with codes organized per challenge.  
- 📑 The design report shall **not be handwritten**; it should be a **README file** in the GitHub repo.

## 🏆 Grading Rubrics  
The grading rubrics shall have the following components:  

- ✅ Number of test cases passed  
- 📐 Code structure, quality, and reusability  
- 🐞 Debugging capability  
- 📖 Design report
